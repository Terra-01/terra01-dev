# Terra's Developer Portfolio Template

A clean, modern, and easily customizable developer portfolio built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Its most powerful feature is a robust, CSS-variable-driven theming system that allows for creating and switching between multiple predefined themes inspired by iconic GMK keycap sets.

## Customization Guide

To personalize this template, you only need to edit a few key files.

-   **Global Identity:**
    -   `src/app/page.tsx`: Edit your **Name, Title, and Tagline** in the `<header>`.
    -   `public/`: Replace `profile.jpg` with your image and `cv.pdf` with your resume.

-   **Theming:**
    -   `src/app/globals.css`: **Add or edit theme color palettes** here. Each theme is a block of CSS variables under a `[data-theme="..."]` selector.
    -   `src/components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx`: **Update the `themes` array** to add your new theme to the dropdown menu.

-   **Content (Markdown):**
    -   `src/content/`: **Edit the `.md` files** (`about.md`, `experience.md`, `projects.md`, etc.) to fill in your personal information.

-   **Links & Services:**
    -   `src/components/Socials.tsx`: Update the `href` values with your profile URLs.
    -   `src/components/ContactModal.tsx`: Paste your unique Formspree ID into the `useForm` hook.
